### brief

```JS
<script lang='ts'>
	let count:int = $state(0);
	//count is just a number, not object/function
</script>

<button onclick={() => count++}>
	clicks : {count}
</button>
```
Creates a *reactive state*, which requires no API

***
### Deep state (proxy)

If array/object is passed **all the nested data in it is also reactive** and svelte keeps track of that. array methods work and the new data is also proxied.

**svelte wraps object in proxy...so arr[0] is a proxy not the OG object**
-> base object is not mutated directly.

```JS
let { done, text } = arr[0];
```
done and text are normal variables, not reactive.

***
### Classes

*classes are not proxied*, but the class_fields can be managed by $state
```JS
class Todo {
	done = $state(false);

	constructor(text) {
		this.text = $state(text);
	}

	reset() {
		this.text = '';

		this.done = false;
	}
}
```
